**Questions to Clarify:**

1. For the new color scheme, would you prefer a deep ocean blue palette, a lighter sky blue palette, or a sophisticated teal/turquoise palette?
2. For star ratings, would you prefer them to remain yellow (as it's a universal standard) or change to match your new color scheme?
3. Do you have any specific hotels or pages that are higher priority for the redesign, or should I proceed with the hotel detail page first as you mentioned?

**Summary:**

This comprehensive redesign will transform your website from its current gold-accented, emoji-heavy design to a sophisticated, modern, and professional aesthetic. The focus will be on clean layouts, professional color schemes, proper iconography, improved spacing, and enhanced user experience. The redesign will maintain all functionality while dramatically improving the visual appeal and usability. Starting with the hotel detail page and homepage hero will give you immediate visual impact, and we can then systematically update the rest of the site for consistency.
