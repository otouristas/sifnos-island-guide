    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "viewAllFaqs": "View All FAQs",
    "q1": "What is the best area to stay in Sifnos?",
    "a1": "The best area to stay in Sifnos depends on your travel style. Platis Gialos offers the longest beach with family-friendly hotels. Apollonia provides central access and nightlife. Artemonas attracts couples seeking elegant village atmosphere. Kamares suits travelers wanting port convenience.",
    "q2": "How many days do you need in Sifnos?",
    "a2": "Most travelers need 3-4 days in Sifnos to experience the island properly. This allows time to visit the best beaches (Platis Gialos, Kamares, Vathi), explore historic villages (Kastro, Apollonia), enjoy the renowned food scene, and take a pottery workshop.",
    "q3": "Is Sifnos expensive?",
    "a3": "Sifnos offers accommodation for all budgets. Budget hotels start around €40-€80 per night, mid-range options range €80-€150, while luxury hotels and villas cost €200-€500+ per night. Dining costs €25-€80 per day depending on preferences. Overall, Sifnos is more affordable than Mykonos or Santorini.",
    "q4": "When is the best time to visit Sifnos?",
    "a4": "The best time to visit Sifnos is from May to October when the weather is warm and ideal for swimming. July and August are peak months with higher temperatures and crowds. For a more peaceful experience with pleasant weather, consider visiting in June or September when the sea is still warm but the crowds have thinned out.",
    "q5": "How do I get to Sifnos from Athens?",
    "a5": "Sifnos is accessible by ferry from Piraeus port in Athens. The journey takes approximately 2.5 to 5 hours depending on the type of ferry (high-speed or conventional). There is no airport on Sifnos, so sea travel is the only option. Book ferry tickets in advance during peak season."
